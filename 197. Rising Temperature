# Write your MySQL query statement below

-- basically we need to compare values in the same table

-- question: are the records ordered by date?
-- the above question doesn't matter since we only need to compare with the previous date

select w1.id from weather w1 join weather w2 on 
datediff(w1.recorddate, w2.recorddate)=1
where w1.temperature > w2.temperature;

-- select w1.id, w1.temperature w1t, w2.temperature w2t from weather w1 join weather w2 on datediff(w2.recorddate, w1.recorddate)=1
-- where w1.temperature < w2.temperature;

-- 2, 3, 4 if datediff(w1.recorddate, w2.recorddate)
-- 1, 2, 3 if datediff(w2.recorddate, w1.recorddate)

-- ()
