# Write your MySQL query statement below
select p.project_id, round(sum(e.experience_years)/count(p.project_id),2) average_years from project p
join employee e on p.employee_id = e.employee_id
group by p.project_id;

-- Complexity e is employee, p is projects
-- O(e*p) + O(plogp)

-- can be improved by creating an index on employee
