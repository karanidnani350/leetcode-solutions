# Write your MySQL query statement below

-- product_id, dates, units, price, units*price

select p.product_id, round(coalesce(sum(p.price*u.units)/sum(u.units), 0),2) average_price from prices p
left join unitssold u on p.product_id = u.product_id and purchase_date between p.start_date and p.end_date
group by p.product_id;

-- Complexity. Assume u is units, p is products
-- O(u * p) for the left join
-- O(u * p) for the between function
-- group by is (plogp)

-- O(u * p) + O(plogp)
